<p>People too angry.</p>
<p>Weather too cold</p>
<p>Always yearning to be somewhere else.</p>
<p>I got my wish.</p>
<p>Found a better life, made a living.</p>
<p>Hard work and stress in a foreign land.</p>
<p>Abuse of alcohol, long hours and no friends.</p>
<p>Wash, rinse and repeat.</p>
<p>Would someone notice that I had gone missing.</p>
<p>Stepped over my end of road.</p>
<p>I was drunk.</p>
<p>Step away from depths of a lough.</p>

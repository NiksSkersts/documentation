<p>I understand that it's silly to care for these things, but it does feel bad when the only argument your opposition can make, is "Oh, you don't like this because you're a homophobe!"</p>
<p>Disclaimer for people who might think that I am against Pride - I have been to Pride. It doesn't matter if you're straight, bi, or gay. It's a nice thing to do, to commemorate people who have died because they were gay or trans, the same way we remember people who gave their lives for Latvia. They gave their lives to allow us to be where we are now.</p>
<p>I appreciate that, and I will continue to thank them for that, be it in Pride or "Lāčplēša diena." It's also great because people always seem to be happy at Pride. It's good to surround yourself with positive thoughts and energy.</p>
<p>That said, I disagreed with Pride 2021 in Riga. Why? Because it was unfair that traditional celebration gets to be online, while Pride has an opportunity to happen offline. Does that make me a homophobe? Probably yes, because, nowadays, if you disagree with LGBTHVZ stupidity, it makes you a homophobe, transphobe, and hvzphobe. Baltic Pride caved in eventually. It's going to be a Pride bus offline, while everything else is going to be online.</p>
<p>Now, I am a homophobe, a proud one at that. I still support gay marriage, and I still like gay folk adopting children. Sure, gay folk aren't the best family model, but it's still better than having no family. </p>
<p>I also support trans folk who wish to change their gender. Why would I care? I won't change my gender. I like being male, but if you want to do it - more power to you. Nietzsche said, "Can't live a good life without pain." For me, gender change is just a patchwork for people who wish to live a life without pain. You're going to die. We all are going to die eventually. It's silly to care for your gender when you could spend all that money to travel or do the stuff you love, but as I said, "More power to you."</p>
<p>Why am I an "anti-vaxxer"? Quite easy. I believe that every person has the right to make bad or good choices. Do I think that not vaccinating is a bad call? Yes, I do. You should vaccinate. I have had shots against Hepatite, HPV, tuberculosis, and whatever stuff was dangerous at the time. I am still alive. It's the same thing with Covid. The difference is, I won't force or blame you for not doing it. If you catch Covid, the treatment should be free of charge. It's the human thing to do. In the same way, we don't deny people healthcare just because we don't like what they say or do.</p>
<p>The argument "For the safety of the people" no longer applies here as well. We have had "all you can have" vaccines for nearly six months now. If the person decided not to vaccinate, it is on them. Your health and well-being is on you, not society. Just like we can't force you to stop smoking or speeding, we can't force you to vaccinate. All we can do is deal with the consequences, be it paying for your hospital visit or your funeral.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, I wish we would live in the perfect world where every politician said only the truth, everyone was vaccinated, and nobody would hit or shoot their human fellows. Unfortunately, we don't, so I urge you to think about yourself and the people around you. Respect the choices of other people and be a nice person.</p>

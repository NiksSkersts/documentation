    <li> <h5>What I can do:</h5> </li>
    <ul> 
        <li>Programming - Learning C# mainly, but I have Java, C, and C++ in my "to learn" list. [in that order].</li>
        <li>System management - I maintain Arch workstation, Debian server and I am versatile enough in Windows. macOS? Haven't used it much, but I will learn it if the need arises.</li>
        <li>Databases - PSQL is my main. I maintain DBs for my ASP.NET web apps, Radicale and Miniflux. I know a bit of Oracle XE and I have set up Oracle DB on Windows and Linux.</li>
        <li>Networks - I have successfully configured Mikrotik and Cisco switches, and projected structured cabling for the course "Computer Networks".</li>
        <li>WWW - HTML, CSS, and a sprinkle of JS. I have worked with Bootstrap and Foundation 6. Design ain't my bae, but I keep trying nonetheless.</li>
    </ul>

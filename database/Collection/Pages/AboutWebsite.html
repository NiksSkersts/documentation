<p>Ever since I was a child, I loved playing video games like Mount&Blade Warband or Minecraft.</p>
<p>I wasn't particularly good at them, but I loved playing them because they allowed me to be myself.</p>
<p>While my friends made magnificent castles, I made a hut. I kept adding and removing stuff until it was perfect, and when it was perfect, I kept adding more to make it more perfect.</p>
<p>Even though I stopped playing video games, the wish or the need to create my place still exists.</p>
<p>This website, in a way, is like my house in Minecraft. As long as I draw my breath, I have the potential to add the things I love, remove the things I don't need, and upgrade the stuff that hasn't aged well. That's what I plan to do.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, thank you for taking interest in me and my website!</p>

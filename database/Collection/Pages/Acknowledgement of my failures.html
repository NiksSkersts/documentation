<p>To start, it comes as no surprise that I have my opinions. I also have the right to defend my views, and I often do, but just like any human, I can go overboard. To account, my inability to control my behavior while defending my views lead me to lose friends whom I hold dear. What I want myself, and anyone who's reading, to understand. It's alright to have different views, and it's okay to defend them, but it's not okay to be disrespectful while doing it. I do my best to prevent this from ever happening again, but I have failed a few times.</p>
<p>Next, I have the unfortunate trait to be gluttonous. I love to eat, especially when I am stressed, but recently I began a fight. I was going to go out, become more active and eat less. My failure here is, I did that for a few months and then stopped doing it. I gave up. I kept breaking my daily calories, even though I made sure I eat well every day. I stopped running because "I had more important things to do." which translates to "I don't want to do it.".</p>
<p>Even my daily walks suffered. I used to go for 10km walks every day, which then transformed into "every day except today.". Why this happened, I have no idea, but this failure keeps popping up in my head.</p>
<p>To continue. My treatment towards people whom I was supposed to love has been abysmal. I never did apologize for the bad behavior towards my exes. I could try and excuse myself with: "I have never been the one for having people around. I love to be alone.", but to be fair, that's not an excuse. When I first began dating, I was worse than I am now, which is an improvement, but it's still not enough. For me, they were never enough: "Not active enough, too active, too boring, nothing in common." I kept hurting them while they swallowed all of it and kept pretending that everything is okay. </p>
<p>The first person I dated for real was and is an amazing woman. We were in a relationship for a while, and then I left for Ireland. I still have the teddy bear she gave me. I became cold, and after months of neglect, we broke up over the phone. To be precise, she called me because I couldn't give a damn. It wasn't the last time I did that. I thought only about myself and didn't even think about how the other person would feel, and it seems to be a common theme in all of my romantic relationships. Great failure.</p>
<p>To end. I don't think there is anything wrong with perfecting yourself, but recently it has become an obsession. I don't mean doing sports, but by being toxic towards myself. I have fallen into a habit of shaming myself each time I eat anything. I count every calorie and worry about how much I am eating, even if it's like 100 calories. During my studies, I stayed up late so I could do extra. I left no time for myself to rest or to do my hobbies. I woke up at seven in the morning and finished at eleven in the evening. I still do it. I feel okay, but despite that, I understand that it's not healthy.</p>

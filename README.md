Projects included:

- [project_four](https://github.com/NiksSkersts/project_four)
- [assets](https://github.com/NiksSkersts/assets)
- [documentation](https://github.com/NiksSkersts/documentation)

Be warned that project_one is the only project that has seen the light of day. Project_two, project_three are training projects meant to improve my skill in C# and C++. 
Project_four - TBD.    

>    Project_three has the potential to see the day of light, as I would like to have:
> - 1 active C# project,   
> - 1 active C++ project,
> - 1 active C project.     
>
> Project_four might become the basis for my Bachelor's thesis. My hope is to use Arduino and C.
